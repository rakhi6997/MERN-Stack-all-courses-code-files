// Note : Similar to the email serviceâ€™s send() method, 
// the save() function uses the data that accompanies a buy event, 
// logging it to the console instead of actually inserting it into a database. 
// This method needs the email of the purchaser, 
// price of the ticket, and the 
// time the ticket was purchased to function.
