// To manage these messages in another file, 
// define the variable via exports object.

// step 1: define an array of meesages
exports.messages = [
    "A change of environment can be a good thing!",
    "You will make it!",
    "Just run with the code!"
    ];

// To manage these messages in another file, 
// define the variable via exports object.

// NOTE : The exports object is a property of the 
// module object. module is both the name of
// the code files in Node.js and one of its global objects.
// exports is shorthand for module.exports.

// step 2 : You can test this module by creating 
// another file called printMessages.js
