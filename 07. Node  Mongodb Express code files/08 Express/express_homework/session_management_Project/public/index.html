1.  What is an Authorization Request Header?
( First look at : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication ), 
then read answer below

The HTTP Authorization request header contains the 
credentials to authenticate a user agent with a server.
APIs use authorization to ensure that client requests access data securely. 
This can involve authenticating the sender of a request 
and verifying that they have permission to access or manipulate the relevant data.

Syntax
Authorization: <type> <credentials>
type : Basic

<credentials>
If the "Basic" authentication scheme is used, the credentials are constructed like this:
The username and the password are combined with a colon (aladdin:opensesame).
The resulting string is base64 encoded (YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l).
Note: Base64 encoding does not mean encryption or hashing! This method is equally secure as sending the credentials in clear text (base64 is a reversible encoding). Prefer to use HTTPS in conjunction with Basic Authentication.

Examples
Authorization: Basic YWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuc2VzYW1l

2. req.session.user  
The code prints the Auth header data
Basic cm9ja3k6YWRtaW4xMjM=
Error: You are not authenticated

then further shows a pop up box due to this line of code 
res.setHeader("WWW-Authenticate", "Basic")

On entering some username and password, the code 
var auth = new Buffer.from(authHeader.split(' ')[1],
			"base64").toString().split(":")
accepts the username and password.

if (username == "rocky" && password == "admin123") then a new session object is created.
			req.session.user = "rockysuven"

On re-running or refereshing the index.html file , 
no authentication would be needed, due to session file.
